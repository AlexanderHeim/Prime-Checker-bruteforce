# Prime-Checker-bruteforce
A python function that returns whether an input is prime or not. Takes advantage of the fact that every prime number greater than 3 is of form 6k-1 or 6k+1. It also makes use of the fact that every composite number is made up of atleast one prime factor smaller than or equal to the squareroot of itself.
